# tic_tac_toe
In here I'll apply the principles of OOP to create a simple game of Tic-tac-toe

#update october 6th

in here I've attempted to use what ive learned of tdd to refactor the TTT using a red-green-refactor process, I've had to refactor a lot of the main functions so that they could have been tested. I still could not manage to create test for some functions, but the overall product is already quite superior to what I have developed prior.

It was also great to see how far I've grown on those 5 months.
